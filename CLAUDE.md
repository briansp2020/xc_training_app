# XC Training Data — developer notes

See [README.md](README.md) for what this project is, how to run it, current state, and roadmap. See [docs/SERVER_SCHEMA.md](docs/SERVER_SCHEMA.md) for the upload contract.

This file covers things that aren't obvious from reading the code.

## Tech stack

- Flutter 3.44, Dart 3.x
- `health` ^13.3.1 (Health Connect on Android, HealthKit on iOS)
- `http` ^1.6.0
- `shared_preferences` ^2.5.5 (auth token, onboarding state, route-upload dedup — the sync watermark lives on the server, `GET /me/last-sample-time`)
- Kotlin on Android, Swift on iOS, minSdk 28

## Coding conventions

- `dart format` clean, `flutter analyze` must pass
- Prefer simple, readable code over clever abstractions
- Surface errors to the user on screen — never silently swallow
- Comment only when the "why" is non-obvious

## Server config

Both `_serverBase` and `_googleServerClientId` in `lib/main.dart` are read from `--dart-define`s at build time:

```
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=config/dev.json -d <device-id>
```

`config/dev.json` is per-developer and gitignored; copy `config/dev.json.example` to start. The defaults (when no flag is passed) are `http://10.0.2.2:8000` (the Android emulator's alias for the host's localhost) and an empty Google client ID (Google Sign-In disabled, dev-login still works).

**The shared server runs at `https://xc-server.duckdns.org`** — reachable from any network, valid TLS, no tunnels needed. Use it unless you're developing against a local server.

For a *local* server: from the emulator use `http://10.0.2.2:8000`; from a physical phone either `adb reverse tcp:8000 tcp:8000` + `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (USB) or the host's LAN IP with the server bound to `0.0.0.0`. Local HTTP only works because the Android manifest allows cleartext traffic (`android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"`) and iOS has a dev-only `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads` exception in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` — both can be removed once local HTTP dev is no longer needed.

## Auth

Every request to the server needs `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`. Two ways to get one:

1. **Google Sign-In** (`POST /auth/google`) — exchanges a Google ID token for the server JWT. Requires the Google Cloud Console setup below.
2. **Dev login** (`POST /auth/dev-login`) — accepts any email and issues a JWT. Only available when the server is run with `DEV_MODE=true`. No Cloud Console setup needed.

The token is persisted in `shared_preferences` and replayed on every sync. 401 responses drop the token and force the user back to the sign-in card. See `lib/auth_service.dart`.

### Google Sign-In setup (one-time per project)

1. Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create or select a project, and enable the **Identity Services API**.
2. **OAuth consent screen** → set up an "External" consent screen (Internal works only inside a Google Workspace org). Required scopes: `openid`, `email`, `profile`.
3. **Credentials** → **Create credentials** → **OAuth client ID**, once per platform:
   - **Web application** — this is the *audience* the server validates ID tokens against. Copy its client ID into `config/dev.json` as `GOOGLE_SERVER_CLIENT_ID` and tell the server about it too.
   - **Android** — package name `com.github.codingwithwarren.xctraining`, SHA-1 of the keystore you sign with. Get the debug SHA-1 with `keytool -list -v -keystore "%USERPROFILE%/.android/debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android`. Add the release SHA-1 once you have a release keystore.
   - **iOS** — bundle ID `com.github.codingwithwarren.xctraining`. Put its client ID into `ios/Runner/Info.plist` as `GIDClientID`, and add the **reversed** client ID (`com.googleusercontent.apps.<id>`) as a URL scheme under `CFBundleURLTypes` so the sign-in callback returns. The iOS client is separate from the web client passed as `serverClientId`.
4. Add test users on the OAuth consent screen until you publish the app — Google rejects sign-ins from accounts that aren't listed during the "Testing" phase.

The `google_sign_in` package (v7+) uses Android's Credential Manager API under the hood, so no `google-services.json` is required — just the OAuth client IDs registered above.

**The ID token's `aud` differs by platform.** On Android it's the *web* client ID; on iOS it's the *iOS* client ID — the GoogleSignIn-iOS SDK always stamps the app's own client ID, and `serverClientId` only produces a `serverAuthCode`, not a different audience. So the server must accept **any** of the project's client IDs as a valid audience, not a single pinned value, or iOS sign-ins fail with `401 "Google token audience mismatch"`. See [docs/SERVER_SCHEMA.md](docs/SERVER_SCHEMA.md) "Auth".

## Android / Health Connect gotchas

These bit us during development and aren't obvious from the code:

- `MainActivity` must extend `FlutterFragmentActivity`, not `FlutterActivity`. The `health` package's permission launcher uses `registerForActivityResult()` which needs a `ComponentActivity`.
- `Health().configure()` must be called before any other health operations — it registers the permission launcher. Without it you get "Permission launcher not found".
- Use `Health().hasPermissions()` on startup; don't force re-grant every launch.
- **Total vs Active calories are separate Health Connect permissions.** The `health` package's workout reader internally queries `TotalCaloriesBurnedRecord`, so the manifest needs `READ_TOTAL_CALORIES_BURNED` even though our Dart code uses `HealthDataType.ACTIVE_ENERGY_BURNED`. Without it, workout reads silently return empty (the package swallows the SecurityException).
- **Fitbit doesn't always write `ExerciseSessionRecord` for activities it tracks** — treadmill sessions in particular show up only as raw HR + step streams. This is why the server detects sessions from raw signals instead of trusting the explicit workouts list.
- Pixel Pro Fold has two displays. To screenshot the right one via adb: `screencap -p -d <display-id>`. To keep the screen on during dev: `adb shell settings put global stay_on_while_plugged_in 7`.

## iOS / HealthKit gotchas

Building for Apple needs the full **Xcode** app (not just Command Line Tools) plus **CocoaPods**. After `flutter pub get`, run `pod install` in `ios/` if pods drift.

- **Signing:** a free Apple ID works for on-device dev (7-day builds), but the team needs a **registered device** — connect the iPhone *before* Xcode can issue a provisioning profile (otherwise "your team has no devices"). Set the team + toggle the **HealthKit** capability in Xcode → Runner target → Signing & Capabilities; the entitlement file (`ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements`) is already wired. TestFlight/App Store needs the paid Developer Program.
- **Deployment target is iOS 14** (the `health` plugin's floor). It's set in both the `Podfile` and the Xcode project — keep them in sync.
- **The `health` plugin uses CocoaPods, not Swift Package Manager** (you'll see a warning saying so); the other plugins use SPM. Both are integrated.
- **Debug builds crash instantly when launched from the home screen** on iOS 26 ProMotion devices — a null deref in `VSyncClient` / `createTouchRateCorrectionVSyncClientIfNeeded` ([flutter#183900](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/183900)). It's a Flutter engine bug for *untethered debug* launches, **not** an app bug. **Test with release builds**, which is also how TestFlight runs.
- **Install/launch with `flutter build` + `devicectl`, not `flutter run`** — the latter's launch step is flaky on Xcode 26 ("Timed out waiting for CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR"). The **phone must be unlocked** for the launch step (otherwise "device was not, or could not be, unlocked"); set Auto-Lock → Never during dev.
  ```
  flutter build ios --release --dart-define-from-file=config/dev.json
  xcrun devicectl device install app --device <udid> build/ios/iphoneos/Runner.app
  xcrun devicectl device process launch --device <udid> com.github.codingwithwarren.xctraining
  ```
- **HealthKit usage strings** live in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` (`NSHealthShareUsageDescription`; the app only reads, so there's no Update key). A missing string crashes the app the moment it requests authorization.
- **"Workout Routes" is its own HealthKit read permission**, defaults OFF, and **iOS never reveals read-permission status to the app** — a denied route permission just returns empty, silently. If routes don't show, check Settings → Privacy & Security → Health → XC Training → Workout Routes is on. Routes only exist for outdoor GPS workouts (indoor workouts have none).
- **No separate route-consent step on iOS.** Health Connect needs one (via the Android-only `xctraining/route_access` method channel in `MainActivity.kt`); HealthKit covers routes with the standard permission. So onboarding is **2 steps** on iOS (health → auto-upload) vs 3 on Android.
- **App Transport Security blocks cleartext HTTP** — see "Server config" for the dev-only `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads` + `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` in `Info.plist`.
